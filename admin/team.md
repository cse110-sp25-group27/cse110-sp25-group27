<img src='./branding/PowellRangersLOGO.png' width='100%' >

We're the Powell Rangers, a plucky group of students whose mission is to defeat bad software engineering practices and save the industry.

## Headquarters:
[Powell Ranger Station](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/cccidaho/items/cccidaho1216.html)

## Important Values:
Live for freedom, justice, and all that is good. Never reveal your face to anyone who is not a fellow Ranger, or a trusted ally. Never escalate a battle unless absolutely necessary.

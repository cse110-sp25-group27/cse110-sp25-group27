## Sprint Goals Recap
- Ensure that the forms and backend functions communicate properly
- Ensure that the styling and html files are linked to the correct functions
- Ensure that there are no issues with false population issues
- Styling issues with the cards
- Frontend and backend continued communication
- Make sure that the CRUD operation unit tests are corrected to new formatting

## Complete Work
- Styling/positioning for the cards on the landing page
- Got form to link to backend functions
- Adjusted form to single format
- Functions for reviewForm will control and populate the data required for front/back modules
- Depreciated not used files/html files (template values)

## Incomplete/Pending Work
- Data still not populating the page
- Data is still not stored into localstorage
- Styling for the page is still incomplete for the form positioning
- Need to adjust the "attendent" to someone else (boo)
- CRUD unit tests are still being developed/changed/reformatted
- More streamlined switch from landing to view page

## Demos (Feature Walkthrough)
- Frontend: User can open the form and populate it with data/send it. User can switch to view page (through hyperlink)
- Backend: Data is being seen by functions and are populating the information backend (not visible on the page though)

## Sprint Metric
- Velocity: 5

- Planned:
  - Ensure that the forms and backend functions communicate properly
  - Ensure styling and HTML files are linked to the correct functions
  - Resolve false population issues
  - Address styling issues with the cards
  - Maintain frontend and backend communication
  - Correct CRUD operation unit tests to match new formatting
- Delivered:
  - Completed styling/positioning for the cards on the landing page
  - Linked form to backend functions
  - Adjusted form to single format
  - Implemented functions for reviewForm to control and populate data for front/back modules
  - Deprecated unused files/HTML templates (template values)

## Feedback & Discussions
- CRUD operations should link to the site and populate the data
- Frontend and backend need to continue communication about what is needed
- Avoid writting tests that are different from frontend, reduce the need to refactor
- Ensure that the frontend team updates page in response to backend (adaptive programming, both ways)

## Next Steps
- Get localStorage to work with the data
- Get the page to populate the data for viewing
- Reformatting the pages so that the data shows correctly
- Change the positioning for the form so that it doesn't block data
- Ensure that the information (assets and data) that is put into the localStorage is kept and stays on the page on reload
- Make sure that functions and operations aren't breaking on invalid inputs, ensure security and safety

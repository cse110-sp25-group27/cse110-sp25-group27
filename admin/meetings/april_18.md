1:45pm:
- Creating logic for flipping top card of the deck using a combo of JS and CSS
- Javascript will save the state of the card: flipped or not. if flipped, it will conditionally render the correct CSS.
- Therefore, there will be two types of CSS styling for the top card.

- Shuffling and flipping has JS/CSS issues
- Prachi branch off trying grid shuffle
- Trying to fix errors with shuffle and flip

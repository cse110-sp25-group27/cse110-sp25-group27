## Sprint Goals Recap
- Complete HTML skeleton code for auto-populating data from localstorage
- Partially finish test code and unit tests for the CRUD operations
- Basic Styling for the landing and viewing pages
- Start testing CRUD operations on frontend to see if they are fully functional and start on styling/positioning

## Complete Work
- Website UI Design
  - Completed design of overall website and layout of pages
  - Finish uploading basic pictures for layout of the website
- Viewing/Landing Page
  - Complete basic HTML and CSS styling/positioning for data and information from localstorage
  - Start on positioning and debugging information that may be populating incorrectly
  - Ensure that the page formatting is correct even when filled with information
- Injecting JSON for testing HTML
  - Testing to see if the CRUD operations are working
  - Ensure that the HTML and CSS are functional after injection for testing
- 


## Incomplete/Pending Work
- Need to refactor Custom HTML Element
  - Instead of one custom element, we will need two elements to correspond to front and back module templates created by the frontend team. 
- Still working on the CSS styling for the HTML pages
  - Left incomplete for now because we want to focus on the HTML and JS first before completing the styling to avoid any implementation issues.
- Injecting JSON with working CRUD operations
  - Need to ensure that the operations are communicating with HTML correctly
  - Format CSS and HTML to make page visually appealing
  - Ensure that there are no breaks or JS errors
  - Operations do not cause other parts to break
- 

## Demos (Feature Walkthrough)
- Frontend: Landing/Viewing pages, show template or pages that the user can interact with. Cards laid out and arrows to traverse and move to different cards. JS operations and clicking is still in progress as there is no communication between HTML and JS yet.
- Backend: N/A, need to test the functionality of the CRUD operations and make sure the no duplicate rule works

## Sprint Metric
- Velocity: [Number of Story Points Completed]
    1. Basic styling completed (landing/viewing)
    2. Start injecting data to test styling
    3. Ensure that communication is partially working
    4. Start on adaptive styling

- Planned vs. Delivered: [Planned Points vs. Delivered Points]
    Planned: 
    1. Finish styling for landing
    2. Finish styling for viewing
    3. Finish injection testing for JSON
    4. Finish JS interactions with the pages
    - Delivered: 
    1. Finish styling for landing
    2. Finish styling for viewing

## Feedback & Discussions
- Discuss the implemenation of the card form along with animation and how to make that an interacive user-friendly element without going too much into the developer perspecitve
- Continued communication between frontend and backend teams
- Ensure that the operations are working on both sides, make sure that there are no conflicts
- Ensure that the HTML and CSS are factoring in reponse to the data injections

## Next Steps
- Frontend needs to continue on testing injection
  - Ensure that reformatting and styling isn't broken
  - Ensure that the HTML is displaying correctly
- Frontend needs to continue updating backend on the information for how the pages are formatted
  - Adapt CRUD operations to information and pages
  - Ensure that the operations display information like planned
  - Get interactions working with page navigation
- Continued communication between both teams
  - Make sure everything is working correctly
  - Updates on bugs and potential issues

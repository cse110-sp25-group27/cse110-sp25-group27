- Task manager (To-do list) but on cards
  - Create cards with tasks to complete
  - Read the cards and review them
  - Update the tasks with other things such as like if something has a certain date or time to complete it
  - "Delete" the card by completing it (can be like a crumpling effect), or just deleting it if you don't need it anymore
  - Maybe there can be a "long-term" category where there are tasks that need to be completed but not immediately
    - Can be like long-term goals or tasks that can be completed literally whenever
    - User can swipe right to "accept" the task and do it today or swipe left to "decline" the task and do it another day swipe to move onto the next itemDigital Birthday cards

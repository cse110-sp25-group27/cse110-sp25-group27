### Notes - 5/14
- Code review for CRUD; updated delete operations
- need to communicate with frontend about establishing reviewCard elements

- Issue
  1. what if a user entered duplicate movie names
    - create a new review card
    - go to 'update' and append new info the user enters
    - pop up notification that there are existing copies, and let them continue if they want to and prompt them to change/specify the name further for variation
    - check for both title and image source? 
  2. unique movie title or unique ID?
    - there are movies with duplicate names
    - how do we distinguish between them? suggestions: movie poster, release dates
<br>make an ADR on this
